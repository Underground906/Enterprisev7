## What Was Done

### UI Component Library — Pipeline Completion
- **Completed all 40 kits** through the 5-phase pipeline (was 5 kits at start of Feb 19)
- Fixed 3 kits that failed during batch run:
  - **Strivo**: Connection errors on full fetch. Solved by fetching 8 sections individually (Dashboard, Messages, Tasks, Events, Projects, Settings, Sign up & Onboarding, Integrations). 49 screens, 8 templates.
  - **Travel Planner Light**: Same connection errors. Solved by fetching 7 pages individually. 28 screens, 26 templates.
  - **Untitled UI Pro**: HTTP 400 (file too large). Solved by targeted node extraction of 5 specific nodes. 76 screens, 30 templates.
- **Added 2 new kits** (not in original 38):
  - **Core Dashboard Builder** (`CiyOckN4TAM0u6mfSsl4QI`): 65 light/desktop screens, 44 templates, 44 PNGs
  - **Tuskter CRM** (`t5IRTNkDbSGsiLrtawggae`): 87 light/desktop screens, 20 templates, 20 PNGs
- **Removed Fitness Pro** (deleted by user from all records)
- **Finder PNGs blocked**: Figma rate limit with Retry-After: ~4 days. All data present, 89 PNGs pending. Retry after Feb 23.

### Final Library Numbers
- **40 kits** in KIT_INDEX, CORE_LAYOUT_LIBRARY.json, and BATCH_PIPELINE_CHECKPOINT.json
- **3,633 screens** analyzed
- **1,785 unique templates** identified
- **~1,696 representative PNGs** exported (89 Finder pending)

### Scripts Created/Modified
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/strivo_phases.py` — Generic Phase 2-5 runner (accepts kit name as CLI arg)
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/core_dashboard_phases.py` — Phase 2-5 for Core Dashboard Builder (light-only filter)

---

## Key Decisions
1. Section-by-section fetching strategy for files that timeout on full fetch
2. Fitness Pro permanently removed (user decision)
3. Core Dashboard Builder and Tuskter CRM added to expand library

## Carry-Forward
| Task | Priority | Blocked By |
|------|----------|------------|
| Finder 89 PNGs | HIGH | Figma rate limit (retry Feb 23) |
| Re-run PRD matcher with 40 kits | HIGH | Nothing |
| PostgreSQL import of structured JSON | MEDIUM | Nothing |
| Visual component browser | MEDIUM | DB import |
