## MARKET CONTEXT

### The Home Furnishing Landscape

**Market Size (UK):**
- £18B+ home furnishing market annually
- £6B+ in Greater London alone
- 12,000+ furniture/home retailers in London
- Average order value: £800-2,500
- Growing 6-8% annually

**The E-Commerce Reality:**
- 45% of furniture purchased online
- But 75% of customers still want to see/touch first
- Average customer visits 3-5 sites before purchase
- Cart abandonment: 70%+
- Returns rate: 15-25%

**Why This Sector is CHAOS:**
- Product catalogs are massive (1,000-50,000 SKUs)
- Products are complex (dimensions, materials, customization)
- Customer questions are endless
- Comparison shopping is exhausting
- Delivery is complicated (lead times, access)
- Assembly questions post-purchase
- Style matching is subjective

**The AI Opportunity:**
An AI concierge that actually understands furniture, design, and the customer's needs is a MASSIVE competitive advantage. Most furniture sites are terrible at helping customers decide.
