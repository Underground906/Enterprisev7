# 90-DAY GOAL INTAKE — Combined Life Plan
## Business + Fitness + Personal | Feb 14 — May 15, 2026

**Owner:** John
**Created:** 2026-02-14
**Review Date:** Weekly (Sunday evening)
**Milestone Checks:** Fortnightly

---

## PART 1: THE LANDSCAPE

### 1.1 Life Domains

This plan covers THREE domains, not just business:

| Domain | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Business** | Revenue, platforms, career — what pays the bills and builds the future |
| **Fitness** | Physical development, movement mastery, body composition — feeling good in your body |
| **Personal** | Health (gut issues), nutrition, daily structure, recovery, mental clarity |

### 1.2 Current State (Brutal Honesty)

**Business:**
- PCL: 45% done — all strategy/research/PRDs complete, visual production is the bottleneck
- Enterprise OS V7: Architecture defined, system operational, needs ongoing maintenance
- UI Component Library: 19,659 components catalogued, search API working, 30+ kits mapped
- Fitness App: Knowledge captured (4,630 exercises, 3,857 videos, 252 artifacts) but NO live app
- Other projects (Dog, Voice, Chatbot): Parked with PRDs filed

**Fitness:**
- No consistent training routine
- Extensive knowledge captured but not applied to own body
- Sedentary work pattern (long sessions at desk)
- No structured approach to movement throughout the day

**Personal/Health:**
- Suspected gut issues: H. pylori, SIBO, gastritis, upper stomach pain after eating (increasing)
- Diet: Too much junk food, crisps, sugar. Not enough protein, greens, fruit
- No structured daily schedule balancing work and physical activity
- Tendency toward 20-hour unstructured sessions causing anxiety spirals

## PART 2: THE 90-DAY PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: PROPERTY CONNECT LONDON — Visual Production & MVP
**Domain:** Business
**Target:** All 81+ pages designed, brand identity locked, MVP deployable
**Revenue milestone:** First paying clients by end of 90 days

### Priority 2: COMPLETE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
**Domain:** Fitness
**Target:** Daily movement habit established, all training modalities active, visible body composition change
**Health milestone:** Gut issues being addressed, 150g protein daily, clean eating established

### Priority 3: FITNESS APP MVP
**Domain:** Business + Fitness (crossover)
**Target:** Working app with video library, AI chat, daily routines, progress logging
**Why now:** You need this app to run your own fitness system — you're the first user

### Priority 4: DAILY LIFE STRUCTURE
**Domain:** Personal
**Target:** Structured days with 2-hour blocks, movement integrated between sessions, evening recovery routine
**Why now:** Without structure, everything falls apart

---

## PART 3: FITNESS — COMPLETE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

### 3.1 Training Philosophy

**Goal:** Establish the habit of moving the body in ALL directions each day, training ALL movement patterns, across ALL training effects — in smart progression.

**Not just "working out"** — building a complete physical development system covering:
- All muscle groups
- All movement patterns
- All ranges of motion
- All planes of motion
- Multiple training effects (hypertrophy, neuromuscular control, cardio, power)

### 3.2 Weekly Training Structure

| Day | Primary Focus | Secondary (Hypertrophy) | Movement Breaks | Evening |
|-----|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Monday** | Cardio | 10-15 min hypertrophy | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Tuesday** | Explosive/Plyo | 10-15 min hypertrophy | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Wednesday** | Strength Endurance | 10-15 min hypertrophy | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Thursday** | Cardio | — | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Friday** | Explosive/Plyo | — | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Saturday** | Strength Endurance | — | GST + Balance | Sivananda Yoga |
| **Sunday** | Active Recovery / Light Movement | — | Gentle mobility | Extended Yoga |

### 3.3 Training Components (Layered System)

**Layer 1: Primary Sessions (45-60 min, morning or midday)**

| Focus | Days | What |
|-------|------|------|
| Cardio | Mon, Thu | Skipping (rhythm/coordination), boxing, running, cycling — building aerobic base |
| Explosive/Plyo | Tue, Fri | Box jumps, depth jumps, clap push-ups, med ball throws, sprint intervals — power + speed |
| Strength Endurance | Wed, Sat | High-rep bodyweight circuits, kettlebells, sustained effort — muscular endurance |

**Layer 2: Hypertrophy Block (10-15 min, 3x/week — Mon, Tue, Wed)**
- Strict hypertrophy focus: controlled tempo, 8-12 reps, 60-90s rest
- Target different muscle groups each day
- Progressive overload week to week
- Can be done immediately after primary session or as separate block

**Layer 3: Movement Breaks — Gymnastic Strength Training (throughout the day)**
- Coach Sommer's Gymnastic Bodies exercises
- Done BETWEEN work sessions (every 2 hours)
- 10-15 minutes per break
- Includes: hollow body holds, L-sits, handstand work, pike stretches, bridge progressions
- Plus: balance drills (single leg stands, eyes closed, unstable surfaces)
- Purpose: Combat sitting, build real-world strength, neuromuscular control

**Layer 4: Evening Recovery — Sivananda Yoga (20-40 min)**
- 12 Basic Sivananda Asanas (spine-centred)
- Trauma-sensitive approach (from your cue library)
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): 1-2 min per posture, many pauses
- Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7): 2-3 min per posture, smoother transitions
- Phase 3 (Weeks 8-12): 3-5 min per posture, silence dominates
- Purpose: Recovery, wind-down, spine health, flexibility, nervous system regulation

**Layer 5: Skill Work (woven into sessions)**
- Skipping: rhythm, coordination, footwork patterns — warm-up for cardio/plyo days
- Boxing: combinations, shadow boxing, bag work — woven into cardio days
- Agility: ladder drills, cone work — woven into plyo days

### 3.4 Training Qualities Covered

| Quality | Where It Comes From |
|---------|-------------------|

- Hypertrophy: moderate load, track weights
- GST: progress to harder variations
- Yoga: Phase 2 (2-3 min per posture)
- Skipping: 10 min rounds, alternating feet
- Boxing: combinations, bag work
- **Success = consistency + measurable improvement**

**Weeks 8-12: POTENCY**
- Full 60 min primary sessions
- Hypertrophy: progressive overload, near failure
- GST: advanced holds, longer durations
- Yoga: Phase 3 (3-5 min, silence dominates)
- Skipping: complex patterns, double unders
- Boxing: sparring drills, sustained rounds
- **Success = visible body composition change + all habits locked in**

## PART 4: NUTRITION & GUT HEALTH

### 4.1 Gut Health Protocol

**IMPORTANT: See a doctor for proper diagnosis of suspected H. pylori / SIBO / gastritis. This is a framework, not medical advice.**

**Immediate actions:**
- [ ] Book GP appointment for H. pylori breath test / stool test
- [ ] Start food diary — log what triggers stomach pain
- [ ] Eliminate known irritants: alcohol, coffee on empty stomach, spicy food, NSAIDs

**Gut-supportive foods:**
- Bone broth (soothes stomach lining)
- Ginger tea (anti-inflammatory)
- Fermented foods: kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi (introduce slowly)
- Slippery elm, marshmallow root (coating agents — supplement)
- L-glutamine (gut lining repair — supplement)
- Zinc carnosine (gastritis support — supplement)

**Supplements to research:**
- Mastic gum (traditional H. pylori support)
- DGL licorice (stomach lining protection)
- Probiotics (specific strains for gut health — Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Saccharomyces boulardii)

### 4.2 Daily Nutrition Targets

| Target | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Protein | 150g/day minimum | Chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yoghurt, whey protein |
| Vegetables | 5+ servings/day | Dark greens (spinach, broccoli, kale), variety of colours |
| Fruit | 2-3 servings/day | Berries, bananas, apples |
| Water | 2.5-3L/day | Hydration supports gut healing |
| Fibre | 30g/day | From vegetables, oats, legumes |

**ELIMINATE:**
- Crisps
- Sugary snacks and drinks
- Processed junk food
- Excessive refined carbs

**Simple meal framework:**
- **Breakfast:** Eggs + spinach + oats OR protein smoothie (banana, berries, whey, spinach)
- **Lunch:** Chicken/fish + rice/potato + large salad/veg
- **Snack:** Greek yoghurt + nuts OR protein bar
- **Dinner:** Lean protein + vegetables + complex carb
- **Evening:** Bone broth or ginger tea (gut soothing)

### 4.3 Body Composition Goal

**Target:** Reduce excess body fat, build lean muscle, feel good in your body
**Method:** Slight caloric deficit (200-300 cal) + high protein (150g) + progressive training
**Tracking:** Weekly weigh-in (same time, same conditions), monthly progress photos
**Timeline:** Visible change by Week 6-8 if nutrition is consistent
