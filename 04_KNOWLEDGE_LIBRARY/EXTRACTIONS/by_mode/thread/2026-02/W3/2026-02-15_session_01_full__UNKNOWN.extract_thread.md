**Summary:** The session began with research into the RB2B visitor identification tool, which led to the conception of a much more comprehensive platform called LeadEngine, designed for B2C businesses like estate agents. A complete build specification was created, including 6 core modules, a 7-day sprint plan, deployment architecture, and supporting systems for design and video production. The session concluded with plans for a marketing book and content strategy.
