# PCL DATA PRD
## Data Sourcing, Products & Intelligence Platform

---

## OVERVIEW

PCL Data is the intelligence layer powering all other PCL products. It aggregates property data from 20+ sources, enriches it with AI, and delivers actionable insights to professionals and consumers.

**Differentiator:** Content + Data fusion. Competitors offer data OR content. PCL offers both, creating unique value.

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Key Competitors

| Competitor | Focus | Pricing | Weakness |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Adema.ai** | Planning intelligence, ML analytics | £1,500-3,000/mo | Over-engineered, narrow focus |
| **Nimbus Maps** | Off-market sourcing, owner contacts | £299-999/mo | Legacy tech, B2B only |
| **PropertyData** | API for property analytics | £49-299/mo | Raw data only, no insights |
| **Hometrack** | AVMs, portfolio analytics | £2,000-10,000/mo | Enterprise dinosaur |
| **TwentyEA** | Investment analysis | £1,000-3,000/mo | Institutional focus |

### What They ALL Miss

1. **Content + Data Fusion** — None combine editorial with data
2. **Community Intelligence** — No crowd-sourced insights
3. **Multi-Channel Distribution** — Data-only, no media presence
4. **B2B2C Model** — Either B2B OR B2C, not both
5. **AI-Native Content** — They use AI for analysis only, not content

### PCL Advantage
- Use PropertyData API as foundation (£149/mo)
- Add AI insights layer
- Bundle with content ecosystem
- Sell at 3-5x premium
