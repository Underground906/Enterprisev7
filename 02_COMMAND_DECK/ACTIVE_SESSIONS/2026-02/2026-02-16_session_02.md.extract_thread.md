**Summary:** The session defined a strategic pivot to build a UI Component Library Factory first, after identifying the manual Figma-to-React conversion as a critical bottleneck. A 6-stage pipeline was established, and work began on batch exporting design kits, with the goal of enabling rapid assembly of multiple platforms once the factory is operational.
