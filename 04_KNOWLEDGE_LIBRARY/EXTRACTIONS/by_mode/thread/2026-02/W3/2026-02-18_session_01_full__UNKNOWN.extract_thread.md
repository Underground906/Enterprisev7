**Summary:** A 6-hour session successfully implemented a 5-phase mechanical pipeline to extract and catalog UI components from Figma kits, processing 5 kits to produce 242 screens, 152 unique templates, and 152 PNGs, while documenting the methodology and fixing security and bug issues. The work establishes a foundational JSON database library for searching across 40+ kits, replacing costly AI vision approaches.
