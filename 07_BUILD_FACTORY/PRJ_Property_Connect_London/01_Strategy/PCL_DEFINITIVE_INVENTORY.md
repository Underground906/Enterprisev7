# PROPERTY CONNECT LONDON — DEFINITIVE PRODUCT & SERVICE INVENTORY

**Extracted from:** 38 threads + 52 artifacts + V7 LATEST_THINKING + Pillar Strategy + Monetization Strategy + Data Opportunities + B2B Vendor Equivalents + Competition Sweep + All Service Pages + Master Overview
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Purpose:** Every single product, service, app, hub, spoke, tool, data product, and revenue stream mentioned ANYWHERE — before any prioritization decisions are made.

---

## PART 1: THE HUB

**Property Connect London (PCL)** = the intelligence & matching layer for London property.

Position: Bloomberg Terminal × Forbes × LinkedIn for London property.
Sits ABOVE portals (Rightmove, Zoopla), agencies (Savills, Foxtons), and data providers (Land Registry, Hometrack).

Not a portal. Not an agency. Not a media site. All three fused — each part feeds the others.

**Competitive white space (from Competition Sweep):** No competitor currently combines editorial authority + real-time data intelligence + buyer/seller/investor matching + tools & dashboards + neutral positioning + London-first depth + multi-format media. That stack does not exist in one place.
