DAY-BY-DAY WORK LOG\n\n### **February 13, 2026 (Session 01)**\n**Projects Worked On:** System Cleanup, Project Setup, Property Connect London (PCL), Enterprise Platform, UI Component Library, Fitness Platform, Dog Platform, Voice Platform  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Routed 6 Figma items from V7 root to `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/`\n- Distributed 8 PRDs across 5 projects + 2 pillars\n- Created missing READMEs for Core Engine and Template Hub\n- Created `PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md` (992 lines, combining PRD_5 + Google Notebook)\n- Created `PRJ_Enterprise_Platform` with full 9-folder scaffold\n- Created brand identity brief for PCL (logo lockups, color palette, typography, component source mapping)\n- Updated PCL strategy to reflect full ecosystem (81+ pages, 62 apps, 3 web properties)\n\n**Problems/Errors:** None  \n**Solutions Found:** System cleaned and ready for build work  \n**Decisions Made:**\n1. All Figma items routed to PRJ_UI_Component_Library (not root)\n2. PRDs 6 (Copy) and 7 (Branding) go to domain pillars, not Build Factory\n3. Enterprise OS gets combined Master PRD merging B2B vision + 8-module architecture\n4. Priority stack: PCL > Enterprise OS > UI Library > Chatbot > Fitness > Dog > Voice\n5. Brand colors NOT a blocker — apply after templates are built\n6. PCL is an 81+ page ecosystem (3 web properties, 62 AI apps, 5 spokes) not just a newsletter\n7. 30+ Figma kits mapped to specific component needs across all builds\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/` (9-folder scaffold)\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/02_Product/PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/README.md`\n- `05_TEMPLATE_HUB/README.md`\n- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/STATE_SNAPSHOTS/2026-02-13.md`\n- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_Enterprise_OS_Platform/`\n- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_UI_Component_Library/`\n- Updated Property Connect London progress file\n\n**API Calls Made:** None  \n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Git commit: 9d534ab (51 files, 23,734 lines)\n- PCL scope: 81+ pages, 62 AI apps, 3 web properties, 5 spokes\n- PRDs distributed: 8 across 5 projects + 2 pillars\n\n---\n\n### **February 14, 2026 (Session 01)**\n**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library, Fitness Platform, Enterprise Platform  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Updated KIT_INDEX: removed Roomsfy + Community Management, added Adify + Multi-concept Landing + Finder (final: 38 kits)\n- Imported Finder (178 items) and Multi-concept Landing (18 items) to PostgreSQL via Figma API\n- Created corrected screen inventories for Fitness (AI-driven, 10 MVP + 6 Phase 2 screens) and Enterprise (8 tabs, 47 screens, 7-level permissions)\n- Read Notebook EnterpriseOS summary (7 markdown reports + 3 infographics)\n- Built page picker tool (Flask API + dark UI) then DEPRIORITISED\n- Created boilerplate coverage analysis (38 kits vs 15 page-need categories across 4 builds)\n- Created `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md` with Tier 1 (8 primary), Tier 2 (8 specialist), Tier 3 (4 domain-specific) kits\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- Page picker tool produced 500+ options per page — overwhelming and useless\n- Context loss: kit roles specified before session not properly captured\n- User frustration: \"still too many to choose from\", \"doubled my workload\"\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Pivoted from tool-building to analysis-first approach\n- Created targeted selection methodology instead of broad browsing\n- Logged complete kit role specifications for third time as requested\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- Chroma replaces Real Estate SaaS as core font stack for promo/SaaS (both DM Sans, but Chroma has better pre-header elements + clean black/white/grey aesthetic)\n- Inter stays for Brainwave/dashboard/back-end, DM Sans for front-end/promo only\n- Briefberry: Strictly onboarding + presell vertical sequences, NOT general marketing\n- Square Dashboard: Not top-level boilerplate, but has nice profile components\n- Triply AI: Serves both Property AND Fitness for AI dashboard interfaces\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/KIT_INDEX.json`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/KIT_INDEX.md` (5,151 lines)\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/03_Design/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/03_Design/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/SESSION_SOURCES.md`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/page_picker.py` (Flask API, port 8080)\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/page_picker.html` (dark UI frontend)\n\n**API Calls Made:**\n- Figma API: Finder kit (178 items), Multi-concept Landing (18 items)\n- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)\n\n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- PostgreSQL: 19,837 items, 183 kits (38 target), all target kits imported\n- Page-level items (>800px): 4,464 across target kits\n- Top kits by volume: Stacks Design System (955), Untitled UI Pro (741), Aitentico (507)\n- Screens across all builds: 93 (all covered by existing kits)\n\n---\n\n### **February 15, 2026 (Session 01)**\n**Projects Worked On:** LeadEngine Platform (NEW PRIORITY), UI Component Library  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Researched RB2B (website visitor identification tool) — full product/pricing/API teardown\n- Conceived LeadEngine Platform: AI-powered conversion intelligence platform\n- Created complete build spec: 42 app screens, 18 marketing screens, social content plan, 7-day build sprint\n- Created `DESIGN_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md` — Fabric.js canvas + Figma API renderer + DAM spec\n- Created `VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md` — 171-term motion lexicon + storyboard template + 10 videos needed\n- Created `DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md` — Hosted vs Container deployment, Docker Compose, pricing tiers\n- Updated `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md` with kit-to-screen mapping for all 60 screens\n\n**Problems/Errors:** None  \n**Solutions Found:**\n- Identified gap in RB2B: company-level ID alone insufficient for B2C (estate agents need individual inquiries)\n- Built independent solution: IPinfo.io for company ID, Apollo for enrichment, own AI concierge via RAG+LLM\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- NOT using RB2B API (they'd see and cut out)\n- Building independently with own AI concierge\n- £5,000/month pricing, limited spots, webinar launch model\n- Docker-containerised for per-client deployment\n- Chroma design system for marketing site, Brainwave for app dashboard\n- Remotion + Claude workflow confirmed for all video production (no AE/DaVinci templates)\n- Build own DAM instead of ImageKit.io ($89-349/mo)\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/COMPLETE_BUILD_SPEC.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/DESIGN_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`\n- Updated `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md`\n- `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-under/memory/kit_roles.md`\n\n**API Calls Made:** None  \n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Screen count: 42 app screens + 18 marketing screens = 60 total\n- Deliverables: 94 total (including 10 LinkedIn posts, 10 short-form videos, 4 email sequences, 10 graphics)\n- Revenue targets: £5,000/month per client, 5 clients = £25,000/month, 10 clients = £50,000/month\n- LLM cost per client: ~£70-230/mo baked into £5k price\n\n---\n\n### **February 16, 2026 (Session 01)**\n**Projects Worked On:** System Housekeeping, Fitness Platform  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Full review of all Enterprise OS V7 documentation\n- Fixed stale \"38 pillars\" reference → corrected to 23 pillars (V7 canonical)\n- Created `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md` — tells any LLM what to read at session start\n- Sorted Knowledge Library — session archival working\n- Created `DAILY_PRACTICES.md` (PIL_10)\n- Created `ENTERPRISE_OS_BUILD_ITINERARY.md`\n- Built Fitness App MVP — AI workout generation + health journaling\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- Scattered bucket folders identified needing ingestion:\n  - `Downloads/Notebook EnterpriseOS summary/` — 19 synthesis docs (HIGH)\n  - `Downloads/Enterprise_OS/` — 8 threads + 32 artifacts (MEDIUM)\n  - `Downloads/All_Enterprise_OS/V7 Collective Docs/` — 83 files (LOW)\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` with correct pillar list (23, not 38)\n- Created systematic approach for ingesting scattered content\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- Fitness app is health imperative — build TODAY\n- Enterprise OS gets small daily progress, not death marches\n- All session outputs go in V7 folder, nowhere else\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `00_SYSTEM_ROOT/SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`\n- `PIL_10_WORKING_PRACTICES/DAILY_PRACTICES.md`\n- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ENTERPRISE_OS_BUILD_ITINERARY.md`\n- Fitness App MVP (in `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/`)\n\n**API Calls Made:** None  \n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Pillar count corrected: 23 (not 38 — that was UI kits)\n- Scattered files identified: 19 + 40 + 83 = 142 files needing ingestion\n\n---\n\n### **February 16, 2026 (Session 02)**\n**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library, Figma-to-React Workflow  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Viewed all key Brainwave 2.0 Figma screenshots (sign in, my scenes, explore, settings, profile, etc.)\n- Extracted real Brainwave design tokens → updated globals.css + AppShell.tsx\n- Researched Figma-to-React tools — Anima selected (200/month free tier, $24/mo paid)\n- Pulled direct Figma links for ALL 73 frames in Brainwave kit via API\n- Catalogued 77 page types + 96 component types needed across all platforms\n- Created `BUILD_FACTORY_PIPELINE.md` — locked-in 6-stage process\n- Started batch export script: 8/38 kits done, rest overnight\n- Corrected fitness kit: Befit (NOT Fitness Pro)\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- Built 11 generic boilerplate React components → REJECTED by user as \"AI looking shite, nothing like the Figma designs\"\n- No tool converts Figma to React automatically from URLs — manual plugin use required\n- The bottleneck: every tool (Locofy, Anima, Builder.io) requires manually: open Figma → select frame → run plugin → copy code\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Rejected AI reconstruction approach in favor of real Figma-to-React conversion via tools\n- Selected Anima as best value tool (200/month free, $24/mo paid)\n- Strategy: convert component pages first (one conversion = many components)\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- Priority shift: Build the FACTORY (component library + token system) FIRST\n- Once factory done, every platform (Enterprise, Fitness, Property, LeadEngine) builds in days, not months\n- Same components, swap brand tokens\n- Conversion budget: 150-200 total conversions across 2 months = complete P0+P1 library\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/01_Strategy/BUILD_FACTORY_PIPELINE.md`\n- Updated `globals.css` with Brainwave design tokens\n- Updated `AppShell.tsx` to match Brainwave sidebar/topbar pattern\n- Updated `kit_roles.md`: Fitness Pro → Befit correction\n- Batch progress: `enterprise-os-hub/public/figma-exports/batch_progress.json`\n\n**API Calls Made:**\n- Figma API: pulled 73 frame node IDs from Brainwave 2.0 file\n- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)\n\n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Page types catalogued: 77 total (P0: 11, P1: 10, P2: 56)\n- Component types catalogued: 96 total (P0: ~23, P1: ~13, P2: ~15+)\n- Batch export progress: 8/38 kits completed\n- Anima conversion budget: 200/month free, $24/mo paid\n\n---\n\n### **February 17, 2026 (Session 01)**\n**Projects Worked On:** Enterprise Platform (V7 Infrastructure)  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Created `v7_registry.sql` schema (5 tables: v7_files, v7_sessions, v7_changes, v7_external_sources, v7_system_state)\n- Created `v7_registry.py` (~700 lines) with commands: scan, diff, health, stale, snapshot, session management, chromadb-sync\n- Created `v7_consolidate.py` (~310 lines) for external source consolidation\n- Created `v7_search_api.py` (FastAPI on port 8100)\n- Created `v7_daily.py` (~90 lines) daily maintenance runner\n- Created `META_PRD_ENTERPRISE_OS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- MemoryError in count_lines_words() - large files caused OOM\n- NUL byte ValueError in PostgreSQL - binary content in summary field\n- Unicode encoding error on Windows - box-drawing characters in v7_daily.py\n- Dual Python issue - ChromaDB installed to wrong Python (Anaconda 3.13 vs standalone 3.12)\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Fixed MemoryError with 10MB limit + line-by-line reading\n- Fixed NUL byte issue with sanitize_text() function\n- Fixed Unicode error with ASCII dashes\n- Fixed Python issue with `python -m pip install chromadb`\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- PostgreSQL over SQLite - Already had enterprise_os DB, richer querying\n- ChromaDB local - No API costs, runs on existing Python\n- FastAPI on 8100 - Avoids conflict with existing Flask search_api on 5000\n- Copy-never-move for consolidation - Safety first, user reviews before anything moves\n- Skip collective (588 git objects) and stage1 (91% duplicate) - Only notebook and legacy groups worth consolidating\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCHEMAS/v7_registry.sql`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_registry.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_consolidate.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_search_api.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_daily.py`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/02_Product/META_PRD_ENTERPRISE_OS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`\n- `C:\\Users\\under\\Documents\\V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`\n\n**API Calls Made:** None (all local)  \n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- First scan: 5,663 files registered in v7_files\n- v7_changes: 5,670 records\n- v7_external_sources: 1,276 files inventoried\n- v7_sessions: 1 record\n- v7_system_state: 1 record\n- ChromaDB: 141 markdown files, 5,197 chunks\n- Git commit: 16 files, 43,097 lines\n\n---\n\n### **February 17, 2026 (Session 02)**\n**Projects Worked On:** Enterprise Platform (V7 Infrastructure continued)  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Completed V7 infrastructure layer implementation\n- Created comprehensive LLM bootstrap prompt in `V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`\n- Verified all scripts operational\n- Discussed UI library component gaps\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- UI kit llm_category data is unreliable — OCR analysis produced bad classifications\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Declared llm_category data needs redo later, not to be trusted for component gap analysis\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- LLM bootstrap prompt as portable context - paste into any chat to give full V7 awareness\n- Daily habit: `Sit down > python v7_daily.py > session start > paste LLM prompt > work > session end > stand up`\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `C:\\Users\\under\\Documents\\V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` (complete LLM operating guide)\n- Session logs: `2026-02-17_session_01.md`, `2026-02-17_session_02.md`, `2026-02-17_session_02_full.md`\n\n**API Calls Made:** None  \n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Database state after session:\n  - v7_files: 5,663\n  - v7_changes: 5,670\n  - v7_external_sources: 1,276\n  - v7_sessions: 1\n  - v7_system_state: 1\n\n---\n\n### **February 18, 2026 (Session 01) - Extended into Feb 19**\n**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library  \n**Built/Created:**\n- Created 5 pipeline scripts: `figma_deep_extract.py`, `figma_structure_analyzer.py`, `layout_deduplicator.py`, `figma_export_representative.py`, `prd_layout_matcher.py`\n- Ran pipeline on 5 kits: Brainwave 2.0, Real Estate SaaS Kit, Chroma, Majin, Befit\n- Created `UI_LIBRARY_BUILD_METHODOLOGY.md` canon document\n- Created 30 kit inventory JSONs with component analysis\n- Fixed Figma token security issue (moved from hardcoded to environment variable)\n- Processed 5 kits through all phases\n\n**Problems/Errors:**\n- `absoluteBoundingBox: null` — some Figma nodes lack position data\n- Windows cp1252 encoding — Unicode arrows in print statements cause errors\n- MemoryError on 483MB Befit JSON\n- Canvas boards (>5000px) treated as screens — Befit showed only 5 screens initially\n- Befit Phase 4 PNG export failed with syntax error\n- GitHub push protection blocked due to hardcoded Figma token\n\n**Solutions Found:**\n- Fixed null boundingBox with `or {}` fallback\n- Fixed encoding with ASCII arrows\n- Fixed MemoryError with compact JSON saves (`separators=(',',':')`)\n- Fixed canvas board detection: nodes > 5000px are recursed into\n- Fixed Figma token security: moved to `os.environ.get(\"FIGMA_TOKEN\")`\n\n**Decisions Made:**\n- JSON-first approach replaces AI vision — pulling full Figma document tree and parsing mechanically gives better results at $0 cost\n- Compact JSON saves for large kits to avoid MemoryError\n- Methodology locked into canon before scaling to 40 kits\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/figma_deep_extract.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/figma_structure_analyzer.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/layout_deduplicator.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/figma_export_representative.py`\n- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/prd_layout_matcher.py`\n- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/01_Strategy/UI_LIBRARY_BUILD_METHODOLOGY.md`\n- 30x kit inventory JSONs in `03_CORE_ENGINE/INDICES/kit_inventories/`\n- `MASTER_INVENTORY.json`, `INVENTORY_REPORT.md`\n- Per-kit JSON files in `kit_screens/{Kit}/`\n- 152 representative PNGs (4 core kits)\n\n**API Calls Made:**\n- Figma API: full JSON extraction for 5 kits\n- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)\n\n**Counts/Metrics:**\n- Screens extracted: 344 total (Brainwave: 103, Real Estate SaaS: 62, Chroma: 48, Majin: 29, Befit: 102)\n- Unique templates: 186 total (52%, 26%, 40%, 3%, 67% reduction respectively)\n- PNGs exported: 152/152 (4 core kits), Befit 34 pending\n- PRD matching: 201 PRD screens vs 152 templates → 1 perfect, 34 good, 163 weak, 3 no match\n- Component analysis: 4,560 screens, 32,407 components, 329 unique component types across 30 kits\n- Git commit: 072e9ba (377 files, ~9.5M lines)\n\n---\n\n## 2.

UI_ASSEMBLY_PIPELINE_SPEC.md (Stage 2 approach replaced by JSON-first methodology)\n\n---\n\n## 3. ERROR & SOLUTION LOG\n\n### **Error 1: Wrong Pillar Count**\n- **What went wrong:** System referenced \"38 pillars\" instead of correct \"23 pillars\"\n- **Root cause:** Confusion between UI kits (38) and domain pillars (23)\n- **How fixed:** Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` with correct pillar list\n- **Prevention rule:** Pillar count (23) and kit count (38) must be clearly distinguished in all documentation\n\n### **Error 2: Page Picker Tool Overwhelm**\n- **What went wrong:** Built Flask API + dark UI that showed 500+ options per page — useless\n- **Root cause:** Analysis needed before tool-building; premature implementation\n- **How fixed:** Deprioritised tool, pivoted to analysis-first approach\n- **Prevention rule:** Never build browsing tools before analysis; targeted search > broad browsing\n\n### **Error 3: Generic React Components Rejected**\n- **What went wrong:** Built 11 generic boilerplate React components → user rejected as \"AI looking shite\"\n- **Root cause:** Built from scratch instead of converting actual Figma designs\n- **How fixed:** Viewed actual Brainwave Figma screens, extracted real design tokens, researched proper conversion tools\n- **Prevention rule:** Always use real Figma designs as source, never invent UI from scratch\n\n### **Error 4: MemoryError in File Scanning**\n- **What went wrong:** `count_lines_words()` caused OOM on large files\n- **Root cause:** Reading entire large files into memory\n- **How fixed:** Added 10MB size limit + line-by-line reading\n- **Prevention rule:** Always handle large files with streaming/line-by-line reading\n\n### **Error 5: NUL Byte ValueError in PostgreSQL**\n- **What went wrong:** Binary content leaking into summary/title fields causing encoding errors\n- **Root cause:** Not sanitizing text before database insertion\n- **How fixed:** Created `sanitize_text()` function to strip `\\x00` bytes\n- **Prevention rule:** Always sanitize text inputs before database insertion\n\n### **Error 6: Canvas Boards as Screens**\n- **What went wrong:** Befit kit showed only 5 \"screens\" (actually giant design canvases)\n- **Root cause:** Nodes > 5000px treated as screens instead of containers\n- **How fixed:** Added canvas board detection — recurse into large nodes\n- **Prevention rule:** Screen detection must check for canvas boards (>5000px) and recurse into them\n\n### **Error 7: Hardcoded Figma Token Security**\n- **What went wrong:** GitHub push protection blocked due to hardcoded Figma token in scripts\n- **Root cause:** Token stored in plain text in 4 scripts\n- **How fixed:** Moved to `os.environ.get(\"FIGMA_TOKEN\")`\n- **Prevention rule:** Never hardcode API tokens; use environment variables\n\n### **Error 8: UI Kit llm_category Data Unreliable**\n- **What went wrong:** OCR analysis produced bad component classifications\n- **Root cause:** AI vision approach unreliable for component identification\n- **How fixed:** Declared data untrustworthy, needs redo with JSON parsing approach\n- **Prevention rule:** JSON parsing > AI vision for structural analysis\n\n### **Error 9: System Not Self-Adherent**\n- **What went wrong:** Built tools/processes but didn't follow session logging/indexing/rules\n- **Root cause:** Lack of discipline in following own operating procedures\n- **How fixed:** Created comprehensive `V7_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md` and committed to following it\n- **Prevention rule:** The system must follow its own rules; operations manual is canonical\n\n### **Error 10: Brainwave Inventory Discrepancy**\n- **What went wrong:** Claimed Brainwave missing when it had been partially processed\n- **Root cause:** Cross-session memory loss; Groq run produced data but file was deleted\n- **How fixed:** Complete audit revealed actual state; established PROJECT_STATE.md requirement\n- **Prevention rule:** Project-specific state sheets must carry forward counts and completion status\n\n---\n\n## 4. LOCKED COUNTS & METRICS\n\n### **File Counts**\n- Total files registered in v7_files: 5,663 (Session 2026-02-17)\n- External sources inventoried: 1,276 files across 4 groups (Session 2026-02-17)\n- Duplicates found: 150 files matching existing V7 content (Session 2026-02-17)\n- Session logs: 9 summaries + 5 full transcripts (Feb 13-18)\n\n### **UI Component Library**\n- Target kits: 38 (final KIT_INDEX) (Session 2026-02-14)\n- Kits processed through pipeline: 5 (Brainwave, Real Estate SaaS, Chroma, Majin, Befit) (Session 2026-02-18)\n-"
