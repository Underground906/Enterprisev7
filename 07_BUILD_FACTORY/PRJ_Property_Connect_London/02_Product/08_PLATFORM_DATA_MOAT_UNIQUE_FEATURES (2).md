## THE COPYABLE vs. UNCOPYABLE

### EASILY COPIED (Within 6 Months)
```
❌ AI Chatbots — Anyone can build one
❌ Calculators — Commodity tools
❌ Market Reports — Data is available
❌ Scheduling Tools — Calendly exists
❌ Document Generators — Templates are easy
❌ Basic Dashboards — Standard SaaS
```

### IMPOSSIBLE TO COPY (Your Moat)
```
✅ Behavioral data from YOUR users on YOUR platform
✅ Intent signals from search patterns
✅ Connection intelligence between buyers and sellers
✅ Professional performance data
✅ Network effects (both sides need each other)
✅ Historical patterns unique to your platform
✅ Real-time demand signals
✅ Cross-pillar user journeys
```

**The Rule:** If it can work OFF your platform, it will be copied. If it REQUIRES your platform data, it's your moat.

## PART 4: DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

### What You Need to Track

**User Registration:**
```
- User type (buyer, seller, renter, landlord, investor, professional)
- Journey stage (browsing, researching, active, ready)
- Target areas
- Budget range
- Timeline
- Preferences
```

**Session Behavior:**
```
- Pages viewed (with time)
- Searches performed (with filters)
- Properties viewed
- Properties saved/dismissed
- Tools used (which calculators, how often)
- Content read (which guides, how long)
- Return visits
```

**Engagement Events:**
```
- Enquiries sent
- Viewings booked
- Messages exchanged
- Reviews left
- Documents uploaded
- Transactions completed
```

**Professional Metrics:**
```
- Response times
- Conversion rates
- Client satisfaction
- Content performance
- Profile engagement
```

### Data Schema (Simplified)

```sql
-- User behavior tracking
CREATE TABLE user_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),  -- 'search', 'view', 'save', 'enquiry', etc.
    event_data JSONB,        -- Flexible payload
    session_id UUID,
    device_type VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Search patterns
CREATE TABLE search_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    area TEXT[],
    min_price INT,
    max_price INT,
    property_type VARCHAR(50),
    bedrooms INT,
    features TEXT[],
    results_count INT,
    clicked_results INT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- User journey stage (calculated)
CREATE TABLE user_journey (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    current_stage VARCHAR(50),  -- 'browsing', 'researching', 'active', 'ready'
    stage_entered_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    predicted_action VARCHAR(50),
    predicted_timeline_days INT,
    confidence_score DECIMAL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Professional performance (calculated)
CREATE TABLE professional_metrics (
    professional_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    avg_response_time_minutes INT,
    enquiry_to_viewing_rate DECIMAL,
    viewing_to_offer_rate DECIMAL,
    avg_review_score DECIMAL,
    review_count INT,
    content_engagement_score DECIMAL,
    profile_view_count INT,
    period_start DATE,
    period_end DATE
);
```

**The Key Insight:**
```
Every user action on your platform makes it MORE valuable.
Every transaction improves your predictions.
Every professional success makes consumer trust higher.
Every consumer success attracts more professionals.

This CAN'T be copied because it requires:
- Your users
- Your data
- Your history
- Your network

Competitors would need to start from zero.
By then, you're years ahead.
