## Active Projects

| # | Project | Priority | Status | Next Action |
|---|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Property Connect London | CRITICAL | PRDs done, 17% kit match coverage (from 5 kits) | Re-run PRD matcher with 40 kits for better coverage |
| 2 | Enterprise OS Platform | CRITICAL | Infrastructure built, discipline locked in | Continue system pressure testing |
| 3 | UI Component Library | HIGH | **40/40 kits COMPLETE** — 3,633 screens, 1,785 templates | Finder PNGs (Feb 23), DB import, PRD re-match |
| 4 | Fitness Platform | HIGH | Befit fully processed (34 PNGs) | Build from templates |
| 5 | LeadEngine | MEDIUM | Full spec, deprioritized | On hold until library complete |

## What Happened Yesterday/Overnight (Feb 19-20)
- Completed ALL 40 UI kits through 5-phase pipeline
- Total: 3,633 screens analyzed, 1,785 unique templates, ~1,696 PNGs
- Fixed 3 failing kits with alternative extraction strategies
- Added 2 new kits: Core Dashboard Builder, Tuskter CRM
- Removed Fitness Pro (user decision)
- Finder PNGs blocked by Figma rate limit (retry Feb 23)

## Today's Plan (Feb 20)
- Session wrapped. Next focus areas:
  1. Re-run PRD layout matcher (was 17% with 5 kits, should be much higher with 40)
  2. PostgreSQL import of all structured JSON data
  3. Visual component browser (localhost)
  4. Property Connect London — use matched templates to begin UI production

## Constraints to Attack
1. Finder PNGs blocked until Feb 23 (Figma rate limit)
2. PRD matching needs re-run (17% coverage is stale — based on 5 kits, now have 40)
3. No database yet (blocks searchable library + visual browser)
