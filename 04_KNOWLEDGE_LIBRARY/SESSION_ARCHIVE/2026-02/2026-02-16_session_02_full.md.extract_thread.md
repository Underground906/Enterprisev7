**Summary:** Session 02 involved a critical course correction after the user rejected AI-generated boilerplate components, reinforcing the mandate to convert exact Figma designs. The session uncovered the manual bottleneck of Figma-to-React tools, selected Anima as the converter, and pivoted strategy to prioritize building a comprehensive, reusable component library ('Build Factory') over building any single platform. A batch export of 38 kits is in progress, and plans were made for intensive conversion work to enable rapid platform assembly.
