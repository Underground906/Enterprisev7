**Summary:** This session involved updating the UI kit index, importing missing Figma kits, correcting platform screen inventories, and pivoting from building an overwhelming component browser to performing a targeted coverage analysis. The analysis confirmed 38 target kits cover all 93 screens across four builds, with key decisions made on kit roles and a plan established for focused, per-screen component selection moving forward.
