# SESSION SUMMARY — 2026-02-14 Session 01
> Full log: `04_KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARY/SESSION_ARCHIVE/2026-02/2026-02-14_session_01_full.md`

## What Was Done
1. **KIT_INDEX updated**: Removed Roomsfy + Community Management, added Adify + Multi-concept Landing + Finder. Final: 38 kits.
2. **Figma imports**: Finder (178 items) and Multi-concept Landing (18 items) extracted via API and imported to PostgreSQL.
3. **Screen inventories corrected**: Fitness (AI-driven, 10 MVP + 6 Phase 2 screens) and Enterprise (8 tabs, 47 screens, 7-level permissions, S>C>E governance).
4. **Notebook EnterpriseOS summary read**: Full architecture understanding — body metaphor, 5A Foundation, 17-step pipeline, 16-folder scaffold, 29 artifact types.
5. **Page picker tool built**: Flask API + dark UI. Then DEPRIORITISED — too many results, analysis needed first.
6. **Boilerplate coverage analysis**: All 38 kits analysed against 15 page-need categories across 4 builds. 93 screens all covered.
7. **BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md created**: Tier 1 (8 primary), Tier 2 (8 specialist), Tier 3 (4 domain-specific).

## Key Decisions
- **Chroma replaces Real Estate SaaS** as core font stack for promo/SaaS (both DM Sans, but Chroma has better pre-header elements + clean black/white/grey aesthetic)
- **Inter stays for Brainwave/dashboard/back-end**, DM Sans for front-end/promo only
- **Briefberry**: Strictly onboarding + presell vertical sequences, NOT general marketing
- **Square Dashboard**: Not top-level boilerplate, but has nice profile components
- **Triply AI**: Serves both Property AND Fitness for AI dashboard interfaces

## Monday Next Steps
1. Lock in top-level boilerplates definitively
2. Drill into 93 screens: features, flows, states, blocks, components
3. Targeted Figma API searches (5-10 options per section, not 500)
4. Identify coverage gaps after primary kit mapping
5. Verify Chroma vs Real Estate SaaS design system differences
6. Check if Coreik needs adding to kit index (mentioned but not in 38)

## State Snapshot
