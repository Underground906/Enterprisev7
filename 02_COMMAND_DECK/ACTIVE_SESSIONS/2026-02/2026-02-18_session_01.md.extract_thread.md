**Summary:** Built and validated a complete 5-phase UI component library pipeline that extracts, analyzes, deduplicates, and matches Figma screens against PRD requirements, processing 5 kits and establishing a JSON-first, $0-cost methodology. Critical bugs were fixed, a canon document written, and the system is ready for scaling, though discipline in self-adherence was noted as a pending issue.
