# ENTERPRISE OS V7 — COMPREHENSIVE WORK REVIEW
## February 13-19, 2026

---

## 1. DAY-BY-DAY WORK LOG

### **February 13, 2026 (Session 01)**
**Projects Worked On:** System Cleanup, Project Setup, Property Connect London (PCL), Enterprise Platform, UI Component Library, Fitness Platform, Dog Platform, Voice Platform  
**Built/Created:**
- Routed 6 Figma items from V7 root to `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/`
- Distributed 8 PRDs across 5 projects + 2 pillars
- Created missing READMEs for Core Engine and Template Hub
- Created `PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md` (992 lines, combining PRD_5 + Google Notebook)
- Created `PRJ_Enterprise_Platform` with full 9-folder scaffold
- Created brand identity brief for PCL (logo lockups, color palette, typography, component source mapping)
- Updated PCL strategy to reflect full ecosystem (81+ pages, 62 apps, 3 web properties)

**Problems/Errors:** None  
**Solutions Found:** System cleaned and ready for build work  
**Decisions Made:**
1. All Figma items routed to PRJ_UI_Component_Library (not root)
2. PRDs 6 (Copy) and 7 (Branding) go to domain pillars, not Build Factory
3. Enterprise OS gets combined Master PRD merging B2B vision + 8-module architecture
4. Priority stack: PCL > Enterprise OS > UI Library > Chatbot > Fitness > Dog > Voice
5. Brand colors NOT a blocker — apply after templates are built
6. PCL is an 81+ page ecosystem (3 web properties, 62 AI apps, 5 spokes) not just a newsletter
7. 30+ Figma kits mapped to specific component needs across all builds

**Files Created:**
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/` (9-folder scaffold)
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/02_Product/PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/README.md`
- `05_TEMPLATE_HUB/README.md`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/STATE_SNAPSHOTS/2026-02-13.md`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_Enterprise_OS_Platform/`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_UI_Component_Library/`
- Updated Property Connect London progress file

**API Calls Made:** None  
**Counts/Metrics:**
- Git commit: 9d534ab (51 files, 23,734 lines)
- PCL scope: 81+ pages, 62 AI apps, 3 web properties, 5 spokes
- PRDs distributed: 8 across 5 projects + 2 pillars

---

### **February 14, 2026 (Session 01)**
**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library, Fitness Platform, Enterprise Platform  
**Built/Created:**
- Updated KIT_INDEX: removed Roomsfy + Community Management, added Adify + Multi-concept Landing + Finder (final: 38 kits)
- Imported Finder (178 items) and Multi-concept Landing (18 items) to PostgreSQL via Figma API
- Created corrected screen inventories for Fitness (AI-driven, 10 MVP + 6 Phase 2 screens) and Enterprise (8 tabs, 47 screens, 7-level permissions)
- Read Notebook EnterpriseOS summary (7 markdown reports + 3 infographics)
- Built page picker tool (Flask API + dark UI) then DEPRIORITISED
- Created boilerplate coverage analysis (38 kits vs 15 page-need categories across 4 builds)
- Created `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md` with Tier 1 (8 primary), Tier 2 (8 specialist), Tier 3 (4 domain-specific) kits

**Problems/Errors:**
- Page picker tool produced 500+ options per page — overwhelming and useless
- Context loss: kit roles specified before session not properly captured
- User frustration: "still too many to choose from", "doubled my workload"

**Solutions Found:**
- Pivoted from tool-building to analysis-first approach
- Created targeted selection methodology instead of broad browsing
- Logged complete kit role specifications for third time as requested

**Decisions Made:**
- Chroma replaces Real Estate SaaS as core font stack for promo/SaaS (both DM Sans, but Chroma has better pre-header elements + clean black/white/grey aesthetic)
- Inter stays for Brainwave/dashboard/back-end, DM Sans for front-end/promo only
- Briefberry: Strictly onboarding + presell vertical sequences, NOT general marketing
- Square Dashboard: Not top-level boilerplate, but has nice profile components
- Triply AI: Serves both Property AND Fitness for AI dashboard interfaces

**Files Created:**
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/KIT_INDEX.json`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/KIT_INDEX.md` (5,151 lines)
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/03_Design/BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/03_Design/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/03_Design/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/SESSION_SOURCES.md`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/page_picker.py` (Flask API, port 8080)
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/page_picker.html` (dark UI frontend)

**API Calls Made:**
- Figma API: Finder kit (178 items), Multi-concept Landing (18 items)
- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)

**Counts/Metrics:**
- PostgreSQL: 19,837 items, 183 kits (38 target), all target kits imported
- Page-level items (>800px): 4,464 across target kits
- Top kits by volume: Stacks Design System (955), Untitled UI Pro (741), Aitentico (507)
- Screens across all builds: 93 (all covered by existing kits)

---

### **February 15, 2026 (Session 01)**
**Projects Worked On:** LeadEngine Platform (NEW PRIORITY), UI Component Library  
**Built/Created:**
- Researched RB2B (website visitor identification tool) — full product/pricing/API teardown
- Conceived LeadEngine Platform: AI-powered conversion intelligence platform
- Created complete build spec: 42 app screens, 18 marketing screens, social content plan, 7-day build sprint
- Created `DESIGN_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md` — Fabric.js canvas + Figma API renderer + DAM spec
- Created `VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md` — 171-term motion lexicon + storyboard template + 10 videos needed
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md` — Hosted vs Container deployment, Docker Compose, pricing tiers
- Updated `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md` with kit-to-screen mapping for all 60 screens

**Problems/Errors:** None  
**Solutions Found:**
- Identified gap in RB2B: company-level ID alone insufficient for B2C (estate agents need individual inquiries)
- Built independent solution: IPinfo.io for company ID, Apollo for enrichment, own AI concierge via RAG+LLM

**Decisions Made:**
- NOT using RB2B API (they'd see and cut out)
- Building independently with own AI concierge
- £5,000/month pricing, limited spots, webinar launch model
- Docker-containerised for per-client deployment
- Chroma design system for marketing site, Brainwave for app dashboard
- Remotion + Claude workflow confirmed for all video production (no AE/DaVinci templates)
- Build own DAM instead of ImageKit.io ($89-349/mo)

**Files Created:**
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/COMPLETE_BUILD_SPEC.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/DESIGN_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_LeadEngine_Platform/02_Requirements/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`
- Updated `BOILERPLATE_SELECTIONS.md`
- `~/.claude/projects/C--Users-under/memory/kit_roles.md`

**API Calls Made:** None  
**Counts/Metrics:**
- Screen count: 42 app screens + 18 marketing screens = 60 total
- Deliverables: 94 total (including 10 LinkedIn posts, 10 short-form videos, 4 email sequences, 10 graphics)
- Revenue targets: £5,000/month per client, 5 clients = £25,000/month, 10 clients = £50,000/month
- LLM cost per client: ~£70-230/mo baked into £5k price

### **February 16, 2026 (Session 01)**
**Projects Worked On:** System Housekeeping, Fitness Platform  
**Built/Created:**
- Full review of all Enterprise OS V7 documentation
- Fixed stale "38 pillars" reference → corrected to 23 pillars (V7 canonical)
- Created `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md` — tells any LLM what to read at session start
- Sorted Knowledge Library — session archival working
- Created `DAILY_PRACTICES.md` (PIL_10)
- Created `ENTERPRISE_OS_BUILD_ITINERARY.md`
- Built Fitness App MVP — AI workout generation + health journaling

**Problems/Errors:**
- Scattered bucket folders identified needing ingestion:
  - `Downloads/Notebook EnterpriseOS summary/` — 19 synthesis docs (HIGH)
  - `Downloads/Enterprise_OS/` — 8 threads + 32 artifacts (MEDIUM)
  - `Downloads/All_Enterprise_OS/V7 Collective Docs/` — 83 files (LOW)

**Solutions Found:**
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` with correct pillar list (23, not 38)
- Created systematic approach for ingesting scattered content

**Decisions Made:**
- Fitness app is health imperative — build TODAY
- Enterprise OS gets small daily progress, not death marches
- All session outputs go in V7 folder, nowhere else

**Files Created:**
- `00_SYSTEM_ROOT/SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `PIL_10_WORKING_PRACTICES/DAILY_PRACTICES.md`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ENTERPRISE_OS_BUILD_ITINERARY.md`
- Fitness App MVP (in `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/`)

**API Calls Made:** None  
**Counts/Metrics:**
- Pillar count corrected: 23 (not 38 — that was UI kits)
- Scattered files identified: 19 + 40 + 83 = 142 files needing ingestion

---

### **February 16, 2026 (Session 02)**
**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library, Figma-to-React Workflow  
**Built/Created:**
- Viewed all key Brainwave 2.0 Figma screenshots (sign in, my scenes, explore, settings, profile, etc.)
- Extracted real Brainwave design tokens → updated globals.css + AppShell.tsx
- Researched Figma-to-React tools — Anima selected (200/month free tier, $24/mo paid)
- Pulled direct Figma links for ALL 73 frames in Brainwave kit via API
- Catalogued 77 page types + 96 component types needed across all platforms
- Created `BUILD_FACTORY_PIPELINE.md` — locked-in 6-stage process
- Started batch export script: 8/38 kits done, rest overnight
- Corrected fitness kit: Befit (NOT Fitness Pro)

**Problems/Errors:**
- Built 11 generic boilerplate React components → REJECTED by user as "AI looking shite, nothing like the Figma designs"
- No tool converts Figma to React automatically from URLs — manual plugin use required
- The bottleneck: every tool (Locofy, Anima, Builder.io) requires manually: open Figma → select frame → run plugin → copy code

**Solutions Found:**
- Rejected AI reconstruction approach in favor of real Figma-to-React conversion via tools
- Selected Anima as best value tool (200/month free, $24/mo paid)
- Strategy: convert component pages first (one conversion = many components)

**Decisions Made:**
- Priority shift: Build the FACTORY (component library + token system) FIRST
- Once factory done, every platform (Enterprise, Fitness, Property, LeadEngine) builds in days, not months
- Same components, swap brand tokens
- Conversion budget: 150-200 total conversions across 2 months = complete P0+P1 library

**Files Created:**
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/01_Strategy/BUILD_FACTORY_PIPELINE.md`
- Updated `globals.css` with Brainwave design tokens
- Updated `AppShell.tsx` to match Brainwave sidebar/topbar pattern
- Updated `kit_roles.md`: Fitness Pro → Befit correction
- Batch progress: `enterprise-os-hub/public/figma-exports/batch_progress.json`

**API Calls Made:**
- Figma API: pulled 73 frame node IDs from Brainwave 2.0 file
- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)

**Counts/Metrics:**
- Page types catalogued: 77 total (P0: 11, P1: 10, P2: 56)
- Component types catalogued: 96 total (P0: ~23, P1: ~13, P2: ~15+)
- Batch export progress: 8/38 kits completed
- Anima conversion budget: 200/month free, $24/mo paid

### **February 17, 2026 (Session 01)**
**Projects Worked On:** Enterprise Platform (V7 Infrastructure)  
**Built/Created:**
- Created `v7_registry.sql` schema (5 tables: v7_files, v7_sessions, v7_changes, v7_external_sources, v7_system_state)
- Created `v7_registry.py` (~700 lines) with commands: scan, diff, health, stale, snapshot, session management, chromadb-sync
- Created `v7_consolidate.py` (~310 lines) for external source consolidation
- Created `v7_search_api.py` (FastAPI on port 8100)
- Created `v7_daily.py` (~90 lines) daily maintenance runner
- Created `META_PRD_ENTERPRISE_OS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`

**Problems/Errors:**
- MemoryError in count_lines_words() - large files caused OOM
- NUL byte ValueError in PostgreSQL - binary content in summary field
- Unicode encoding error on Windows - box-drawing characters in v7_daily.py
- Dual Python issue - ChromaDB installed to wrong Python (Anaconda 3.13 vs standalone 3.12)

**Solutions Found:**
- Fixed MemoryError with 10MB limit + line-by-line reading
- Fixed NUL byte issue with sanitize_text() function
- Fixed Unicode error with ASCII dashes
- Fixed Python issue with `python -m pip install chromadb`

**Decisions Made:**
- PostgreSQL over SQLite - Already had enterprise_os DB, richer querying
- ChromaDB local - No API costs, runs on existing Python
- FastAPI on 8100 - Avoids conflict with existing Flask search_api on 5000
- Copy-never-move for consolidation - Safety first, user reviews before anything moves
- Skip collective (588 git objects) and stage1 (91% duplicate) - Only notebook and legacy groups worth consolidating

**Files Created:**
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCHEMAS/v7_registry.sql`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_registry.py`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_consolidate.py`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_search_api.py`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/v7_daily.py`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/02_Product/META_PRD_ENTERPRISE_OS_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`
- `C:\Users\under\Documents\V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`

**API Calls Made:** None (all local)  
**Counts/Metrics:**
- First scan: 5,663 files registered in v7_files
- v7_changes: 5,670 records
- v7_external_sources: 1,276 files inventoried
- v7_sessions: 1 record
- v7_system_state: 1 record
- ChromaDB: 141 markdown files, 5,197 chunks
- Git commit: 16 files, 43,097 lines

---

### **February 17, 2026 (Session 02)**
**Projects Worked On:** Enterprise Platform (V7 Infrastructure continued)  
**Built/Created:**
- Completed V7 infrastructure layer implementation
- Created comprehensive LLM bootstrap prompt in `V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`
- Verified all scripts operational
- Discussed UI library component gaps

**Problems/Errors:**
- UI kit llm_category data is unreliable — OCR analysis produced bad classifications

**Solutions Found:**
- Declared llm_category data needs redo later, not to be trusted for component gap analysis

**Decisions Made:**
- LLM bootstrap prompt as portable context - paste into any chat to give full V7 awareness
- Daily habit: `Sit down > python v7_daily.py > session start > paste LLM prompt > work > session end > stand up`

**Files Created:**
- `C:\Users\under\Documents\V7_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` (complete LLM operating guide)
- Session logs: `2026-02-17_session_01.md`, `2026-02-17_session_02.md`, `2026-02-17_session_02_full.md`

**API Calls Made:** None  
**Counts/Metrics:**
- Database state after session:
  - v7_files: 5,663
  - v7_changes: 5,670
  - v7_external_sources: 1,276
  - v7_sessions: 1
  - v7_system_state: 1

---

### **February 18, 2026 (Session 01) - Extended into Feb 19**
**Projects Worked On:** UI Component Library  
**Built/Created:**
- Created 5 pipeline scripts: `figma_deep_extract.py`, `figma_structure_analyzer.py`, `layout_deduplicator.py`, `figma_export_representative.py`, `prd_layout_matcher.py`
- Ran pipeline on 5 kits: Brainwave 2.0, Real Estate SaaS Kit, Chroma, Majin, Befit
- Created `UI_LIBRARY_BUILD_METHODOLOGY.md` canon document
- Created 30 kit inventory JSONs with component analysis
- Fixed Figma token security issue (moved from hardcoded to environment variable)
- Processed 5 kits through all phases

**Problems/Errors:**
- `absoluteBoundingBox: null` — some Figma nodes lack position data
- Windows cp1252 encoding — Unicode arrows in print statements cause errors
- MemoryError on 483MB Befit JSON
- Canvas boards (>5000px) treated as screens — Befit showed only 5 screens initially
- Befit Phase 4 PNG export failed with syntax error
- GitHub push protection blocked due to hardcoded Figma token

**Solutions Found:**
- Fixed null boundingBox with `or {}` fallback
- Fixed encoding with ASCII arrows
- Fixed MemoryError with compact JSON saves (`separators=(',',':')`)
- Fixed canvas board detection: nodes > 5000px are recursed into
- Fixed Figma token security: moved to `os.environ.get("FIGMA_TOKEN")`

**Decisions Made:**
- JSON-first approach replaces AI vision — pulling full Figma document tree and parsing mechanically gives better results at $0 cost
- Compact JSON saves for large kits to avoid MemoryError
- Methodology locked into canon before scaling to 40 kits

**Files Created:**
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/figma_deep_extract.py`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/figma_structure_analyzer.py`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/layout_deduplicator.py`

- `03_CORE_ENGINE/SCRIPTS/prd_layout_matcher.py`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/01_Strategy/UI_LIBRARY_BUILD_METHODOLOGY.md`
- 30x kit inventory JSONs in `03_CORE_ENGINE/INDICES/kit_inventories/`
- `MASTER_INVENTORY.json`, `INVENTORY_REPORT.md`
- Per-kit JSON files in `kit_screens/{Kit}/`
- 152 representative PNGs (4 core kits)

**API Calls Made:**
- Figma API: full JSON extraction for 5 kits
- Cost: $0 (Figma API free tier)

**Counts/Metrics:**
- Screens extracted: 344 total (Brainwave: 103, Real Estate SaaS: 62, Chroma: 48, Majin: 29, Befit: 102)
- Unique templates: 186 total (52%, 26%, 40%, 3%, 67% reduction respectively)
- PNGs exported: 152/152 (4 core kits), Befit 34 pending
- PRD matching: 201 PRD screens vs 152 templates → 1 perfect, 34 good, 163 weak, 3 no match
- Component analysis: 4,560 screens, 32,407 components, 329 unique component types across 30 kits
- Git commit: 072e9ba (377 files, ~9.5M lines)

- **Active:** 42 files (core infrastructure, methodology, active project files)
- **Stale:** 2 files (page_picker.py, page_picker.html — deprioritised)
- **Superseded:** Sections of BUILD_FACTORY_PIPELINE.md and UI_ASSEMBLY_PIPELINE_SPEC.md (Stage 2 approach replaced by JSON-first methodology)

## 3. ERROR & SOLUTION LOG

### **Error 1: Wrong Pillar Count**
- **What went wrong:** System referenced "38 pillars" instead of correct "23 pillars"
- **Root cause:** Confusion between UI kits (38) and domain pillars (23)
- **How fixed:** Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `MEMORY.md` with correct pillar list
- **Prevention rule:** Pillar count (23) and kit count (38) must be clearly distinguished in all documentation

### **Error 2: Page Picker Tool Overwhelm**
- **What went wrong:** Built Flask API + dark UI that showed 500+ options per page — useless
- **Root cause:** Analysis needed before tool-building; premature implementation
- **How fixed:** Deprioritised tool, pivoted to analysis-first approach
- **Prevention rule:** Never build browsing tools before analysis; targeted search > broad browsing

### **Error 3: Generic React Components Rejected**
- **What went wrong:** Built 11 generic boilerplate React components → user rejected as "AI looking shite"
- **Root cause:** Built from scratch instead of converting actual Figma designs
- **How fixed:** Viewed actual Brainwave Figma screens, extracted real design tokens, researched proper conversion tools
- **Prevention rule:** Always use real Figma designs as source, never invent UI from scratch

### **Error 4: MemoryError in File Scanning**
- **What went wrong:** `count_lines_words()` caused OOM on large files
- **Root cause:** Reading entire large files into memory
- **How fixed:** Added 10MB size limit + line-by-line reading
- **Prevention rule:** Always handle large files with streaming/line-by-line reading

### **Error 5: NUL Byte ValueError in PostgreSQL**
- **What went wrong:** Binary content leaking into summary/title fields causing encoding errors
- **Root cause:** Not sanitizing text before database insertion
- **How fixed:** Created `sanitize_text()` function to strip `\x00` bytes
- **Prevention rule:** Always sanitize text inputs before database insertion

### **Error 6: Canvas Boards as Screens**
- **What went wrong:** Befit kit showed only 5 "screens" (actually giant design canvases)
- **Root cause:** Nodes > 5000px treated as screens instead of containers
- **How fixed:** Added canvas board detection — recurse into large nodes
- **Prevention rule:** Screen detection must check for canvas boards (>5000px) and recurse into them

### **Error 7: Hardcoded Figma Token Security**
- **What went wrong:** GitHub push protection blocked due to hardcoded Figma token in scripts
- **Root cause:** Token stored in plain text in 4 scripts
- **How fixed:** Moved to `os.environ.get("FIGMA_TOKEN")`
- **Prevention rule:** Never hardcode API tokens; use environment variables

### **Error 8: UI Kit llm_category Data Unreliable**
- **What went wrong:** OCR analysis produced bad component classifications
- **Root cause:** AI vision approach unreliable for component identification
- **How fixed:** Declared data untrustworthy, needs redo with JSON parsing approach
- **Prevention rule:** JSON parsing > AI vision for structural analysis

### **Error 9: System Not Self-Adherent**
- **What went wrong:** Built tools/processes but didn't follow session logging/indexing/rules
- **Root cause:** Lack of discipline in following own operating procedures
- **How fixed:** Created comprehensive `V7_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md` and committed to following it
- **Prevention rule:** The system must follow its own rules; operations manual is canonical

### **Error 10: Brainwave Inventory Discrepancy**
- **What went wrong:** Claimed Brainwave missing when it had been partially processed
- **Root cause:** Cross-session memory loss; Groq run produced data but file was deleted
- **How fixed:** Complete audit revealed actual state; established PROJECT_STATE.md requirement
- **Prevention rule:** Project-specific state sheets must carry forward counts and completion status
