## Vision

An AI-native enterprise operating system that transforms fragmented organizational knowledge into compounding competitive advantage. Enterprise OS treats the business as a living organism — 8 functional "organs" working in concert — to capture, route, index, and deploy every piece of intelligence a business produces.

The platform is simultaneously:
1. **The internal backbone** — the file-based knowledge architecture powering all builds
2. **The commercial product** — a white-labelable SaaS platform for teams using AI at maximum effectiveness

## Connective Sub-Systems

### 7-Level Organizational Hierarchy
Permission and visibility architecture from Level 1 (Freelancer) to Level 7 (CEO/Owner). Data is progressively disclosed — higher levels see more of the "Metabolic Output."

### 80+ Role Profile Registry
Specialized "expert brains" (SEO Lead, Data Engineer, Chief of Staff, etc.). When a goal is set, the Stakeholder Map pulls perspectives, risks, and dependencies from relevant roles before work begins.

### 29 Artifact Extraction Engine
On intake, raw content is decomposed into 29 specific types:
1. Frameworks  2. SOPs  3. Decision Logs  4. Code Snippets  5. UI Specs  6. Database Schemas  7. Market Intel  8. Hooks & Messaging  9. Unique Mechanisms  10. Process Maps  11. Role Definitions  12. Brand Rules  13. Copy Formulas  14. Content Strategies  15. Keyword Sets  16. Templates  17. Architecture Specs  18. API Definitions  19. Test Plans  20. Deployment Configs  21. Financial Models  22. Legal Docs  23. Training Materials  24. Performance Metrics  25. Risk Assessments  26. Competitor Analysis  27. User Stories  28. Design Tokens  29. Prompt Patterns

### Staging > Canonical > Execution (S>C>E) Governance
- **Staging** (Raw/Unsafe): Every new upload, AI output, or note starts here
- **Canonical** (Distilled/Stable): Human reviews and clicks "Promote" — becomes Source of Truth
- **Execution** (Generated): AI agents read ONLY from Canonical to produce outputs
