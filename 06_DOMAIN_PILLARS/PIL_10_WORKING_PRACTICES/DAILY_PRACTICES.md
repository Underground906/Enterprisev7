# DAILY PRACTICES — Your Operating Rhythm

**Purpose:** Make the system work FOR you, not be another thing to manage. These habits compound. Do them imperfectly every day rather than perfectly never.

---

## Morning Block (30 min, before anything else)

### 1. Body First (15 min)
- Open Fitness App → do today's workout (AI-generated based on your plan)
- Log how you feel (energy 1-10, sleep quality, any pain)
- This is non-negotiable. Your health runs everything else.

### 2. System Check (10 min)
- Open Enterprise OS V7 → read latest session log in `02_COMMAND_DECK/ACTIVE_SESSIONS/`
- Scan `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/STATE_SNAPSHOTS/` for current priorities
- Pick ONE primary focus for today's work blocks

### 3. Declare Intent (5 min)
- Write 1 sentence: "Today I'm focused on [X]"
- This prevents drift. You don't need to do everything. You need to finish ONE thing.

## Work Blocks (2 hours max each, 2-3 per day)

### Rules
- **Max 3 decisions per block.** If you hit 3, stop and move to execution.
- **Timer on.** When the 2 hours is up, STOP. Save state, log progress, take a break.
- **One project per block.** Don't context-switch mid-block.
- **Start by reading the project's last session log.** 2 minutes of context saves 20 minutes of confusion.

### Block Structure
```
First 5 min:  Read last session log for this project
Next 100 min: Focused work
Last 15 min:  Log what you did, what's next, save all files to V7
```

### What Counts as a Block
- Building features (Fitness App, LeadEngine, PCL)
- Writing content (copy, marketing, specs)
- System housekeeping (ingesting content, filing sessions)
- Research (market research, competitor analysis)
- NOT: scrolling, tinkering with folder structures, reorganizing for the sake of it

---

## End of Day (15 min)

### 1. Log the Day
- Update session log in `02_COMMAND_DECK/ACTIVE_SESSIONS/2026-02/`
- List: what you did, decisions made, what's next tomorrow
- This takes 5 minutes and saves you 30 minutes tomorrow morning

### 2. File Everything
- Any new files → correct location in V7 (or UNROUTED if unsure)
- Any chat transcripts → `04_KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARY/SESSION_ARCHIVE/`
- Nothing left in Downloads root or Desktop

### 3. Tomorrow's Focus
- Write 1 sentence: "Tomorrow's focus is [X]"
- Put it at the top of your session log

## Weekly (Sunday, 30 min)

### Review
- How many work blocks did you complete this week?
- What shipped? What's still stuck?
- Which projects moved forward?
- Did you exercise every day?

### Plan
- Set the week's ONE primary goal
- Identify the 3 most important tasks
- Schedule work blocks (aim for 2 per day, 5 days)

### System Health
- Are there files piling up in Downloads that need ingesting?
- Is the session archive up to date?
- Any scattered outputs that need filing?

## What You Get From This

After 1 week:
- You'll know exactly where you left off every morning
- No more "what was I doing?" panic
- Fitness routine established

After 1 month:
- Searchable archive of everything you've done
- Clear picture of project progress
- Health baseline established
- System paying for itself in saved time

After 3 months:
- Full operational rhythm
- Enterprise OS is a living system, not a folder structure
- Multiple projects shipping
- Health habits locked in

## Anti-Patterns (Things That Break You)

| Pattern | Why It's Bad | What To Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 20-hour unstructured sessions | Leads to anxiety, scattered work, burnout | 2-hour blocks with breaks |
| Reorganizing folders endlessly | Feels productive, ships nothing | Build something, file it, move on |
| Starting new projects before finishing current ones | Everything stays at 5% | Finish one thing, then start the next |
| Not logging sessions | Next session starts from zero | 5 min logging saves 30 min recovery |
| Skipping exercise | Low energy, poor sleep, worse decisions | Body first, every morning |
| Making 10 decisions in one session | Decision fatigue, nothing sticks | Max 3 decisions per block |

---

## The Minimum Viable Day

If you can only do ONE thing:
1. Exercise (15 min)
2. One 2-hour work block
3. Log what you did (5 min)

That's 2 hours 20 minutes. Everything else is bonus. Consistency beats intensity.
