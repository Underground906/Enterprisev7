# Session Log: 2026-02-13 Session 01

## Meta
- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Start:** 11:00
- **End:** 18:30
- **Intent:** System cleanup, project setup, and first proper structured work day

## Block 1: System Cleanup & Foundation (11:00 - 13:00)
- [x] Route 6 Figma items out of V7 root → moved to 07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/
- [x] Gather all PRDs into Build Factory projects → 8 PRDs distributed across 5 projects + 2 pillars
- [x] Create missing READMEs for Core Engine, Template Hub (Knowledge Library already had one)
- [x] BONUS: Created PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md combining PRD_5 + Google Notebook (992 lines)
- [x] BONUS: Created PRJ_Enterprise_Platform with full 9-folder scaffold

## Block 2: Lock In Projects & PRDs (13:30 - 15:30)
- [x] Review and assign PRDs: all 7 projects assessed with maturity grades and status
- [x] Set milestones and current status per project — progress files created
- [x] Update Navigation Centre state snapshot → 2026-02-13.md
- [x] Created priority stack: PCL > Enterprise OS > UI Library > Chatbot > Fitness > Dog > Voice
- [x] Created goal folders for Enterprise OS Platform and UI Component Library

## Block 3: First Real Build Work (16:00 - 18:00)
- [x] Discovered full PCL scope in Downloads/full property/ (81+ pages, 62 apps, 3 web properties)
- [x] Copied all PCL work into Build Factory: 18 PRDs, 9 design assets, 6 strategy docs, 4 architecture docs
- [x] Updated strategy brief to reflect full ecosystem (not just newsletter + landing page)
- [x] Created brand identity brief (logo lockups, color palette, typography, component source mapping)
- [x] Revised progress: PCL is at 45% (strategy/research/PRDs done, visuals are the bottleneck)
- [x] File session summary
- [x] Commit to git → 9d534ab (51 files, 23,734 lines)

## Decisions Made
1. All Figma items routed to PRJ_UI_Component_Library (not root)
2. PRDs 6 (Copy) and 7 (Branding) go to domain pillars, not Build Factory
3. Enterprise OS gets a combined Master PRD merging B2B vision + 8-module architecture
4. Priority stack: PCL > Enterprise OS > UI Library > Chatbot > Fitness > Dog > Voice
5. Brand colors NOT a blocker — apply after templates are built
6. PCL is an 81+ page ecosystem (3 web properties, 62 AI apps, 5 spokes) not just a newsletter
7. 30+ Figma kits mapped to specific component needs across all builds

## Outputs Created
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/` — new project with 9-folder scaffold
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/02_Product/PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER.md`
- `03_CORE_ENGINE/README.md`
- `05_TEMPLATE_HUB/README.md`
- 8 PRDs distributed to correct locations
- 3 projects scaffolded (Fitness, Dog, Voice — were empty shells)
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/STATE_SNAPSHOTS/2026-02-13.md` — full state snapshot
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_Enterprise_OS_Platform/` — goal + progress
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOAL_UI_Component_Library/` — goal + progress
- Updated Property Connect London progress file

## Blockers
- None. System is clean and ready for build work.

## Next Session
1. Outline all screens needed per build (Property Platform MVP, client promo site, customer promo site)
2. Identify boilerplate page layouts as base elements for all main pages
3. Map which kit components go on which pages
4. Learn Figma autolayout for combining elements from multiple kits
5. Stress test the system works for any LLM (not just Claude — verify Enterprise OS is LLM-agnostic)
