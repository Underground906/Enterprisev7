## What This Actually Is

PCL is not a newsletter. It's not a landing page. It's a full property intelligence ecosystem:

**"Bloomberg Terminal + Forbes Media + LinkedIn Network for London property"**

### 3 Web Properties
1. **Presell Site** (propertyconnectlondon.com) — Marketing/education site
2. **The Platform** (app.propertyconnectlondon.com) — B2B Pro Dashboard + B2C Consumer Dashboard
3. **The Spokes** — Magazine, Newsletter, Podcast, Video/CTV landing pages

### Plus
- **62 AI Apps** across 6 B2B suites (Estate Agents, Letting Agents, Investors, Home Furnishing, Mortgage, Developers)
- **7 Offer Funnels** (Free Video, Free Interview, Free Platform, Sponsorship, Editorial, Video Package, Ad)
- **5 Audience-Facing Sections** (Home, Magazine, Connected TV, Platform, Podcasts)
- **10 Content Sections** (Video, Article, Learning, Property, Projects, Jobs, Events, Experts, Q&A, Shop)

### Total Page Count: 81+ pages
| Section | Pages |
|---------|-------|
| Marketing Site | 17 |
| Spokes (Magazine/Podcast/CTV) | 12 |
| Platform Public | 8 |
| Pro Dashboard | 26 |
