# PIL_14_NAVIGATION

**Pillar ID:** PIL_14  
**Domain:** Core System  
**Status:** Active

---

## Purpose

The Navigation System is the **decision and execution engine** for Enterprise_OS. It converts chaotic goals into structured, AI-managed execution paths using the 5A framework (Alignment, Awareness, Accountabilities, Activities, Assets) plus 5 dynamic layers for real-time state management.

This pillar sits **above** all projects, platforms, tools, and agents. While projects come and go, the Navigation System endures.

---

## What Belongs Here

- Goal intake systems (raw → structured)
- 5A framework implementations
- Goal classification schemas
- 90-day accountability structures
- State tracking and decision logs
- Navigation variants (Personal, Business, Enterprise, Skills)

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Working practices / session design → PIL_10_WORKING_PRACTICES
- AI agent definitions → PIL_09_ROLES_SKILLS
- Keyword extraction → PIL_12_KEYWORDS
- Project execution → 07_BUILD_FACTORY
- Daily task management → 02_COMMAND_DECK

## Key Frameworks

1. **5A + 5 Dynamic Layers** — Core navigation framework (Alignment → Assets + State → AI Dialogue)
2. **Goal Intake Pipeline** — CAPTURE → PARSE → GRADE → PLACE → SCHEDULE → TRACK → REVIEW
3. **Goal Classification Schema** — Type/Domain/Specificity/Urgency taxonomy
4. **90-Day Accountability Model** — Time-boxed outcome ownership

## Quick Start

1. **Set a goal:** Use `GOAL_INTAKE_SYSTEM_V1.md` to capture any goal
2. **Classify it:** Apply type/domain/specificity schema
3. **Route it:** Place in correct Navigation variant (Personal/Business/Enterprise/Skills)
4. **Track it:** AI refreshes state daily in `06_State/Current_State.md`
5. **Review it:** Weekly activity check, quarterly 5A realignment

## AI/Agent Instructions

When working with this pillar:
- Use `CONTEXT.md` for full system understanding
- Follow `ROUTING_RULES.md` for content placement
- Check `CANON_STATUS.md` before using any framework
- Log all goal changes in `07_Decisions/Decision_Log/`
