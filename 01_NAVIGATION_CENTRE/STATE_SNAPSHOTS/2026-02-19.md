## Active Projects

| # | Project | Priority | Status | Next Action |
|---|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Property Connect London | CRITICAL | PRDs done, 17% kit match coverage | Improve coverage (process more kits) |
| 2 | Enterprise OS Platform | CRITICAL | Infrastructure built, discipline starting | Pressure test system docs this week |
| 3 | UI Component Library | HIGH | 5/40 kits processed, pipeline proven | Process remaining 35 kits |
| 4 | Fitness Platform | HIGH | Befit Phases 1-3 done, PNGs pending | Export Befit PNGs, build from templates |
| 5 | LeadEngine | MEDIUM | Full spec, deprioritized | On hold until library complete |

## What Happened Yesterday (Feb 18)
- Built complete 5-phase UI Library pipeline ($0 cost)
- Processed 5 kits: 344 screens, 186 templates, 152 PNGs
- Wrote UI_LIBRARY_BUILD_METHODOLOGY.md (canon doc)
- Committed 224 files, pushed to GitHub
- Befit Phase 4 PNGs still pending

## Today's Plan (Feb 19)
- Block 1: System discipline (SYSTEM_MANIFEST, PROJECT_STATE sheets, goals) - IN PROGRESS
- Block 2: Befit PNGs + process more kits
- Block 3: Database + visual browser
- Block 4: Navigation system (goals/milestones/tasks)
- Block 5: Pressure test the system

## Key Docs Created Today
- `00_SYSTEM_ROOT/SYSTEM_MANIFEST.md` (master routing doc)
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ACTIVE_GOALS/GOALS_90DAY.md`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/STATE_SNAPSHOTS/2026-02-19.md` (this file)
- `05_TEMPLATE_HUB/PROJECT_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_UI_Component_Library/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Property_Connect_London/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Enterprise_Platform/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `04_KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARY/DEEPSEEK_REVIEW/2026-W08_Feb13-19/` (19 files for review)

## Constraints to Attack
1. Only 5/40 kits processed (blocks UI Library + PCL matching)
2. No database yet (blocks searchable library)
3. System discipline untested (blocks everything long-term)
4. Befit PNGs missing (blocks fitness UI)
