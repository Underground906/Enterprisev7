# GOAL PLANNING SESSION — 90-Day Clarity

> **Instructions:** Work through this alone first. Be honest. Write rough, not polished.
> Once done, bring it to Claude Code and we'll turn it into executable plans.

## BEFORE YOU START

Block 2 hours. No distractions. Have coffee.

The goal is CLARITY, not perfection. You're not committing to anything yet — you're getting it out of your head and onto paper so you can see it.

---

## PART 1: THE LANDSCAPE (20 min)

### 1.1 What are your active ventures/projects?

List everything you're working on or thinking about. Don't filter.

```
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
```

### 1.2 For each one, what's the CURRENT state?

Be brutal. Where are you actually at, not where you wish you were?

| Venture | Current State | Last Meaningful Progress |
|---------|---------------|-------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### 1.3 What's keeping you up at night?

Write the worries. The things you're avoiding. The decisions you haven't made.

```




```

---

## PART 2: THE 90-DAY FILTER (30 min)

You can't do everything. This section forces prioritisation.

### 2.1 If you could only work on ONE venture for 90 days, which one?

```
Answer:

Why this one?

```

### 2.2 If you could add a SECOND, which one?

```
Answer:

Why this one?

```

### 2.3 Everything else — what happens to it?

For each remaining venture, decide: PAUSE, DELEGATE, or KILL.

| Venture | Decision | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|

| | | |

1. Complete this document (pen and paper is fine, then type up the summary)
2. Open Claude Code and say: "Read GOAL_PLANNING_SESSION.md — I've filled it in"
3. We'll turn your answers into:
   - PRDs for each priority
