**Summary:** Successfully built the complete V7 foundation infrastructure layer in one session, including a PostgreSQL registry, ChromaDB semantic search, consolidation tools, a FastAPI search service, and a daily maintenance workflow—all running locally with zero LLM costs. Key decisions included using PostgreSQL, local ChromaDB, and a copy-never-move consolidation strategy, while several bugs were fixed during development. The system is now ready for daily use and future component work.
