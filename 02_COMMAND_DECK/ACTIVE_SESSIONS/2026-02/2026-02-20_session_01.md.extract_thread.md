**Summary:** This session completed the 5-phase pipeline for 40 UI component kits, resolving fetch errors for three kits via section-based and targeted extraction methods, and adding two new kits. The library now contains 3,633 screens and 1,785 templates, with PNG exports for one kit pending due to a Figma rate limit.
