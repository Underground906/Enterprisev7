# SESSION SUMMARY — 2026-02-16 Session 01

## Focus: System Housekeeping + Fitness App Build

## What's Happening
1. Full review of all Enterprise OS V7 documentation
2. Fixed stale "38 pillars" reference → corrected to 23 pillars (V7 canonical)
3. Created SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md — tells any LLM what to read at session start
4. Sorted Knowledge Library — session archival working
5. Created Daily Working Practices doc (PIL_10)
6. Created Enterprise OS build itinerary
7. Building Fitness App MVP — AI workout generation + health journaling

## Key Corrections
- Pillar count: 23 (not 38 — that was UI kits)
- Updated ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md with correct pillar list
- Identified scattered bucket folders needing ingestion

## Scattered Content Identified (Needs Ingesting)
- `Downloads/Notebook EnterpriseOS summary/` — 19 synthesis docs (HIGH)
- `Downloads/Enterprise_OS/` — 8 threads + 32 artifacts (MEDIUM)
- `Downloads/All_Enterprise_OS/V7 Collective Docs/` — 83 files (LOW)

## Outputs
- `00_SYSTEM_ROOT/SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `PIL_10_WORKING_PRACTICES/DAILY_PRACTICES.md`
- `01_NAVIGATION_CENTRE/ENTERPRISE_OS_BUILD_ITINERARY.md`
- Fitness App MVP (in 07_BUILD_FACTORY/PRJ_Fitness_Platform/)

## Decisions
- Fitness app is health imperative — build TODAY
- Enterprise OS gets small daily progress, not death marches
- All session outputs go in V7 folder, nowhere else

## Next Session
- Continue fitness app if not complete
- Start ingesting scattered bucket folders into Knowledge Library
- LeadEngine build sprint (if Monday)
