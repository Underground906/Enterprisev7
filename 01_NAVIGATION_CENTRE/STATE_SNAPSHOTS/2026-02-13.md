## Active Projects (Build Factory)

### 1. Property Connect London — CRITICAL
- **PRD:** PRD_1 + PRD_8 (B2B Data Services companion)
- **Target:** 2026-02-28 (MVP)
- **Progress:** 10%
- **Maturity:** Speculative
- **Status:** PRDs filed. No build work started. Market research, avatars, keywords all pending.
- **Next:** Move through Build Factory stages — market research, keyword matrix, avatar definitions
- **Revenue potential:** Newsletter + data services SaaS
- **Blockers:** None — just needs focused execution time

### 2. Enterprise OS Platform — CRITICAL
- **PRD:** PRD_5 (original) + PRD_Enterprise_OS_V7_MASTER (combined)
- **Target:** Ongoing (Phase 1: internal dogfood, now)
- **Progress:** 35%
- **Maturity:** Partial — architecture defined, scripts working, docs being filled
- **Status:** V7 structure operational. 8 modules defined. Scripts built. Pillar health mixed (8 empty, 15 partial/healthy). READMEs created. Master PRD combines B2B vision + 8-module architecture.
- **Next:** Fill critical pillar canon docs, stress-test system with real daily use
- **Revenue potential:** White-label SaaS (GBP 99-2000/mo tiers)

### 3. UI Component Library — HIGH
- **PRD:** None (operational tool, not a product PRD)
- **Target:** Ongoing utility
- **Progress:** 80%
- **Maturity:** Operational
- **Status:** 19,659 Figma components catalogued in PostgreSQL. Search API + UI working. Design tokens extracted (Brainwave, Untitled UI). Kit categories filterable. Cull mode active.
- **Next:** Cull junk components, extract more kit tokens, build component assembly workflow

### 4. Fitness Platform — HIGH
- **PRD:** PRD_2
- **Target:** TBD (after Property Connect)
- **Progress:** 5%
- **Maturity:** Speculative
- **Status:** PRD filed. Exercise library JSON exists. Video library exists. No build work started.
- **Next:** Shelved until Property Connect MVP ships. Then: exercise DB schema, video tagging, program builder.
- **Revenue potential:** Subscription app + premium programs
- **Assets on hand:** exercise_library.json, video_library/

### 5. Dog Platform — MEDIUM
- **PRD:** PRD_3
- **Target:** TBD
- **Progress:** 2%
- **Maturity:** Speculative
- **Status:** PRD filed. 9 artifacts exist in PIL_23_DOG_PLATFORM from earlier extraction work. No build work.
- **Next:** Shelved. Queue behind Fitness.
- **Revenue potential:** Content hub + marketplace + community

### 6. Voice Training Platform — MEDIUM
- **PRD:** PRD_4
- **Target:** TBD
- **Progress:** 1%
- **Maturity:** Speculative
- **Status:** PRD filed. No build work. No existing assets.
- **Next:** Shelved. Lowest priority among platform builds.
- **Revenue potential:** Course platform + AI feedback tool

### 7. AI Chatbot Products — HIGH
- **PRD:** None yet (empty shell in Build Factory)
- **Target:** 2026-03-15 (per CLAUDE.md goals)
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Maturity:** Empty
- **Status:** Project folder exists but completely empty. No scaffold, no PRD.
- **Next:** Needs PRD. This is the revenue engine — the "AI chatbot as a service" product that Property Connect is the first instance of.
- **Note:** May merge with or become a sub-project of Enterprise OS Platform

## Priority Stack (Ordered)

| # | Project | Why This Order |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Property Connect London | Nearest revenue. Feb 28 deadline. First product through the factory. |
| 2 | Enterprise OS Platform | The backbone everything runs on. Dogfood it daily. |
| 3 | UI Component Library | Operational. Supports all builds. Maintenance mode. |
| 4 | AI Chatbot Products | Revenue product. Needs PRD. Queued after PCL MVP. |
| 5 | Fitness Platform | Has assets. Queued after PCL. |
| 6 | Dog Platform | Queued. |
| 7 | Voice Training | Queued. |

## Domain Pillar Health (from SYSTEM_HEALTH.md + today's work)

| Status | Count | Pillars |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Healthy | 3 | PIL_08 Ingestion, PIL_10 Practices, PIL_14 Navigation |
| Partial | 12 | PIL_02-07, PIL_12-13, PIL_18-21 |
| Empty | 8 | PIL_01, PIL_09, PIL_11, PIL_15, PIL_16, PIL_17, PIL_22, PIL_23 |

**Critical gaps:** PIL_15 (Enterprise_OS) and PIL_17 (RAG_System) are empty but critical priority.

## Decisions Made Today
1. PRDs 6 (Copy) and 7 (Branding) routed to domain pillars, not Build Factory
2. Enterprise OS gets combined Master PRD merging B2B + internal architecture
3. Priority stack: PCL > Enterprise OS > UI Library > Chatbot > Fitness > Dog > Voice

## Blocked
- Nothing blocked. System is clean and ready for build work.

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Property Connect London: Stage 1 (Market Research) through Build Factory
