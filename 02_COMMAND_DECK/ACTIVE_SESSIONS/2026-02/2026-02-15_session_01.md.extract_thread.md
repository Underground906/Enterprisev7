**Summary:** The session pivoted to prioritize the LeadEngine Platform, a comprehensive AI conversion intelligence platform for estate agents, resulting in a complete build specification, competitor analysis, and a detailed 7-day build plan. Key decisions included building independently of competitors like RB2B and using a Docker-based, per-client deployment model. Outputs were systematically documented for immediate execution starting with the Design Workbench.
