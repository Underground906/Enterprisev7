        "Session ran across two Claude Code conversations due to context limits.",
        "Part 1: Claude built 11 generic React components and 8 demo pages for Enterprise OS hub app, which were harshly rejected by user John as 'AI-looking shite' not matching the intended workflow of converting real Figma templates.",
        "Part 2: Course correction - examined actual Brainwave 2.0 Figma PNG exports to understand real design, extracted design tokens, and began rewriting components.",
        "Part 3: Discovered the real bottleneck: no Figma-to-React tool allows batch URL conversion; all require manual plugin use per frame. Used Figma API to extract direct links to all 73 frames across 20 pages in the Brainwave file.",
        "Part 4: Strategic planning for building a full component library, cataloging 77 page types and 96 component types, selecting Anima as the conversion tool (200 conversions/month), and planning a conversion budget.",
        "Part 5: Batch export script `batch-export-all-kits.js` running, 8 of 38 kits completed, ~15 hours remaining.",
        "Part 6: John's realization that the old approach of months of hand-building and expanding documentation was a 'mirage' and untenable due to token costs. Shift to new approach: Build a component library + token system + boilerplate assembly factory for rapid platform assembly."

A batch export of 38 kits is in progress, and plans were made for intensive conversion work to enable rapid platform assembly.",
